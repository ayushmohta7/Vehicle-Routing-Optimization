# Vehicle Routing Optimization

This project focuses on solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using advanced optimization techniques. The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers, aiming to minimize total travel distance or time.

## Introduction

The Vehicle Routing Problem is central to logistics and supply chain management, impacting the efficiency of deliveries and overall operational costs. This project implements optimization algorithms to provide effective solutions to the VRP, accommodating various constraints and real-world considerations.

## Problem Definition

The objective of the VRP is to determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a given set of customers. Each vehicle starts and ends at a depot, and each customer is visited exactly once. The goal is to minimize the total route cost, which can be defined in terms of distance, time, or other relevant metrics.

## Features

- **Multiple VRP Variants:** Supports different VRP variants, including Capacitated VRP (CVRP), VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW), and others.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling large datasets with numerous customers and vehicles.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to incorporate additional constraints and objectives as needed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushmohta7/Vehicle-Routing-Optimization.git
   cd Vehicle-Routing-Optimization
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**

   Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare input data:**

   Format your input data as specified in the `data/` directory. Ensure that customer locations, demands, vehicle capacities, and other relevant information are correctly specified.

2. **Configure parameters:**

   Adjust the configuration parameters in `config.json` to suit your specific VRP variant and requirements.

3. **Run the optimization:**

   Execute the main script to start the optimization process:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **View results:**

   After execution, results will be available in the `results/` directory, including optimized routes and performance metrics.
